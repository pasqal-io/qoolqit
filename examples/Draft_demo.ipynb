One goal of QoolQit should be to limit and control the information from Pulser that the user interacts with. This can be as simple as redefining the display functions for certain objects, and providing convenience methods for accessing the most relevant information."

    "- I have not yet explored the Layout.\n",
    "- Do we want to allow single-qubit addressability in the interface? I would still skip the whole channel declaration interface, and probably do that through some `qubit_support` or `target` argument for each `Pulse`. Then if a `Pulse` is added to the `Sequence` that targets a specific qubit, the right channel is declared automatically.\n",
    "- I would like to have the option to use the dimensionless model but I have not yet experimented with how I would implement it. Doing the conversions at the level of the Sequence would be easy, but we probably would need a more complex wrapper on the Waveforms to allow non-integer durations. Also, we would need to rework some of the drawing."
