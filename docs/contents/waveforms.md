# Writing time-dependent functions

An essential part of writing programs in the Rydberg analog model is to write the time-dependent functions representing the amplitude and detuning terms in the drive Hamiltonian. For that, QoolQit implements a set of waveforms that can be used directly and/or composed together.

## Base waveforms

A full list of the available waveforms can be found in the [API reference](../api/qoolqit/waveforms/waveforms.md).

```python exec="on" source="material-block" result="json" session="waveforms"
from qoolqit import Constant, Ramp, Delay

# An empty waveform
wf1 = Delay(1.0)

# A waveform with a constant value
wf2 = Constant(1.0, 2.0)

# A waveform that ramps linearly between two values
wf3 = Ramp(1.0, -1.0, 1.0)


print(wf1)  # markdown-exec: hide
print(wf2)  # markdown-exec: hide
print(wf3)  # markdown-exec: hide
```

As shown above, printing a waveform shows the duration interval over which it applies followed by the description of the waveform.

The first argument is always the `duration` of the waveform, and the remaining arguments depend on the information required by each waveform. The resulting object is a callable that can be evaluated at any time $t$.

```python exec="on" source="material-block" result="json" session="waveforms"
wf1(t = 0.0)
wf2(t = 0.5)
wf3(t = 1.0)

print("wf1(t = 0.0) =", wf1(t = 0.0))  # markdown-exec: hide
print("wf2(t = 0.5) =", wf2(t = 0.5))  # markdown-exec: hide
print("wf3(t = 1.0) =", wf3(t = 1.0))  # markdown-exec: hide
```

Each waveform also supports evaluation at multiple time steps by calling it on an array of times.
```python exec="on" source="material-block" result="json" session="waveforms"
import numpy as np

t_array = np.linspace(0.0, 2.0, 9)

wf3(t_array)
print("t =     ", t_array) # markdown-exec: hide
print("wf(t) = ", wf3(t_array)) # markdown-exec: hide
```

In the waveform above, we defined it with a duration of $1.0$, and then evaluated it over nine points from $t = 0.0$ to $t=2.0$. As you can see, all points after $t = 1.0$ evaluated to $0.0$. By default, any waveform evaluated at a time $t$ that falls outside the specified `duration` gives $0.0$.

Waveforms can be quickly drawn with the `draw()` method.

```python exec="on" source="material-block" html="1" session="waveforms"
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # markdown-exec: hide
from docs.utils import fig_to_html # markdown-exec: hide

wf3.draw()
fig = wf3.draw(return_fig = True) # markdown-exec: hide
print(fig_to_html(fig)) # markdown-exec: hide
```

## Composite waveforms

The most straightforward way to arbitrarily compose waveforms is to use the `>>` operator. This will create a `CompositeWaveform` representing the waveforms in the order provided.

```python exec="on" source="material-block" result="json" session="waveforms"
wf_comp = wf1 >> wf2 >> wf3

print(wf_comp)  # markdown-exec: hide
```

The code above is equivalent to calling `CompositeWaveform(wf1, wf2, wf3)`. As shown, printing the composite waveform will automatically show the individual waveforms in the composition and the times at which they are active. These are automatically calculated from the individual waveforms. A
`CompositeWaveform` is by itself a subclass of `Waveform`, and thus the previous logic on calling it at arbitrary time values also applies.

A few convenient properties are directly available in a composite waveform:

```python exec="on" source="material-block" result="json" session="waveforms"
# Total duration
wf_comp.duration

# List of durations of the individual waveforms
wf_comp.durations

# List of times where each individual waveform starts / ends
wf_comp.times

print("Total duration :", wf_comp.duration)  # markdown-exec: hide
print("List of durations :", wf_comp.durations)  # markdown-exec: hide
print("List of times :", wf_comp.times)  # markdown-exec: hide
```

A custom waveform can directly be a `CompositeWaveform`. That is the case with the `PiecewiseLinear` waveform, which takes a list of durations (of size $N$) and a list of values (of size $N+1$) and creates a linear interpolation between all values using individual waveforms of type `Ramp`.

```python exec="on" source="material-block" html="1" session="waveforms"
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # markdown-exec: hide
from docs.utils import fig_to_html # markdown-exec: hide

from qoolqit import PiecewiseLinear

durations = [1.0, 1.0, 2.0]
values = [0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5]

wf_pwl = PiecewiseLinear(durations, values)

wf_pwl.draw()

fig = wf_pwl.draw(return_fig = True) # markdown-exec: hide
print(fig_to_html(fig)) # markdown-exec: hide
```

## Defining custom waveforms

The waveform system of QoolQit can be easily extended by subclassing the `Waveform` class and defining some key properties and methods. To exemplify this we will create a waveform representing a simple shifted sine function,

$$
    \text{Sin}(t)_{\omega, C} \equiv \sin(\omega t) + C
$$


```python exec="on" source="material-block" session="waveforms"
from qoolqit.waveforms import Waveform

import math

class Sin(Waveform):
    """A simple sine over a given duration.

    Arguments:
        duration: the total duration.
        omega: the frequency of the sine wave.
        shift: the vertical shift of the sine wave.
    """

    def __init__(
        self,
        duration: float,
        omega: float = 2.0 * math.pi,
        shift: float = 0.0,
    ) -> None:
        super().__init__(duration, omega = omega, shift = shift)

    def function(self, t: float) -> float:
        return math.sin(self.omega * t) + self.shift
```

A few things are crucial in the snippet above:

- Keeping the `duration` argument as the first one in the `__init__`, and initializing the parent class with that value, to be consistent with other waveforms.
- Passing every other parameter needed for the waveform in the `__init__` and passing it as a **keyword argument** to the parent class. This will automatically create a `params` dictionary of extra parameters, and set them as attributes to be used later.
- Overriding the `function` abstract method, which represents the evaluation of the waveform at some time `t`.
- **Optional**: overriding the `max` and `min` methods. The intended result of `wf.max()` and `wf.min()` is to get the maximum/minimum value the waveform takes over its duration. By default, the base `Waveform` class implements a brute-force sampling method that **approximates** the maximum and minimum values. However, if this value is easy to know from the waveform parameters, the method should be overriden.

To showcase the usage of the newly defined waveform, let's define a new sine waveform and compose it with a piecewise linear waveform.


```python exec="on" source="material-block" result="json" session="waveforms"
from qoolqit import PiecewiseLinear
import math

wf1 = Sin(
    duration = 1.0,
    omega = 2.0 * math.pi,
    shift = 1.0
)

wf2 = PiecewiseLinear(
    durations = [0.5, 0.5],
    values = [1.0, 1.0, 0.0],
)

wf_comp = wf1 >> wf2

print(wf_comp)  # markdown-exec: hide
```

```python exec="on" source="material-block" html="1" session="waveforms"
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # markdown-exec: hide
from docs.utils import fig_to_html # markdown-exec: hide

wf_comp.draw()

fig = wf_comp.draw(return_fig = True) # markdown-exec: hide
print(fig_to_html(fig)) # markdown-exec: hide
```

Following this example, more complete `Sin` waveform is directly available in QoolQit implementing

$$
    \text{Sin}(t)_{A, \omega, \phi, C} \equiv A * \sin(\omega t + \phi) + C
$$

```python exec="on" source="material-block" result="json" session="waveforms"
from qoolqit import Sin

wf = Sin(
    duration = 1.0,
    amplitude = 2.0,
    omega = 6.0,
    phi = -5.0,
    shift = 1.0,
)

wf.max()

print(wf) # markdown-exec: hide

print("Maximum value: ", wf.max()) # markdown-exec: hide



```

```python exec="on" source="material-block" html="1" session="waveforms"
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # markdown-exec: hide
from docs.utils import fig_to_html # markdown-exec: hide

wf.draw()

fig = wf.draw(return_fig = True) # markdown-exec: hide
print(fig_to_html(fig)) # markdown-exec: hide
```
